# 🌌 Hello, I'm @arpeli

### "Systems are just constellations of logic."

I am a software explorer focused on the intersection of low-level systems and the grand scale of the cosmos. Whether I'm optimizing a kernel or analyzing stellar data, I'm driven by a desire to understand how complex environments—both digital and celestial—function under the hood.

## 🎮 Beyond the Code

When I'm not debugging or compiling, you can find me:
* **Gaming:** Exploring procedurally generated universes or mastering high-stakes strategy games.
* **Poetry:** Writing verses that try to capture the silence of the vacuum and the noise of the machine.
* **Stargazing:** Tracking the stars and reminding myself of our place in the cosmic timeline.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

> **Entropy always wins.** The Earth will eventually be destroyed by astrophysical phenomena regardless of what we do. Our code might be ephemeral, but the logic we leave behind is our way of shouting into the void.
